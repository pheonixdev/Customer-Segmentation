# Customer-Segmentation

In this project customers of a mall have been segmented into different categories using K-Means clustering algorithm.
<br/>

Customer segmentation facilitates a company to improve it's relation with the customers. 
This process helps to personalize the marketing and sales efforts to the needs of the respective customer groups which in turn boosts the customer loyalty and revenue growth.
<br/>

K-means clustering is one of the common algorithms used in customer segmentations, where each data point is assigned to a cluster.
The distance from the data points to the centroids are computed in order to assign the points to each cluster. 
Centroid is the centre point of a cluster and is computed by taking the mean of the data points in the cluster.
<br/>

After clustering the dataset into different segments, silhouette coefficient was used to evaluate the quality of clusters created by the algorithm.
The score varies from -1 to +1 and higher the value of the coefficient, the better is the algorithm. 
In addition principal component analysis was performed to improve the score of the model.
